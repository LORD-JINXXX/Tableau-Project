# Tableau-Project
This project is about the Comparative Study of Countries to compare various parameters such as income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio of different countries using the sample insurance dataset and world development indicators dataset.
The objective is to create a dashboard to compare all the parameters mentioned above for different countries, to strategize market penetration and to target new customers.
I mentioned how to approach the project in the project write up file.
